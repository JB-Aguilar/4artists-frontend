## Key Features

### Post to All Users

4Artists allows users to create posts and share their artwork, thoughts, or updates with the entire community. When creating a post, users have the option to make it visible to all users on the platform. This feature encourages open communication and fosters a vibrant community where artists can interact and engage with each other.

### Upload Images in Posts

Artists often want to showcase their artwork visually. 4Artists provides the ability to upload images directly in posts. Users can attach images of their latest creations, works in progress, or event photos to enrich their posts and captivate the audience with stunning visuals.

### Give Likes to Posts

Appreciation and recognition are vital in an artist's journey. With the "Like" feature, users can show their appreciation for a post they find inspiring or impressive. Liking a post not only provides positive feedback to the creator but also helps in boosting the visibility of the post within the community.

The combination of these key features enables artists to freely express themselves, share their work, and connect with other members of the 4Artists community. It promotes a dynamic and supportive environment where artists can thrive, collaborate, and inspire each other to reach new heights in their creative pursuits.
